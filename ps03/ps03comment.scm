;; Hi Andi,

;;  I just read your ps03 essay.  It is very interesting.  I
;; have carefully thought about it and I have learned something
;; from it.  I am considering your points and want to argue
;; about some of them.

;; You are quite right that the purpose of this class is
;; inspiration rather than mastery of technique, so I am
;; certainly happy to give you ps03 credit for that work.

;; Your first paragraph is a pretty good summary of the ideas I
;; have been presenting in the class.

;; Your second paragraph (beginning with "However") seems key
;; to your argument.

;; It is indeed true that the infrastructure required to
;; support efficient generic procedures, for example, is quite
;; complicated, but once implemented it is no longer necessary
;; to look into it, in the same way you do not need to
;; understand how a compiler works to use the source language.
;; Sometimes it takes some serious effort to support a flexible
;; superstructure.  The Jupyter notebook is exactly such a
;; rather complicated infrastructure built to allow rapid
;; prototyping.  I am showing you other infrastructures, to
;; support flexibility, which are not covered by other
;; paradigms.

;; You argue that it is not necessarily a good idea to build a
;; complex infrastructure to support higher-level flexibility
;; because of there is not time, in the current business model,
;; to do that.  You just have to produce novelty at a rapid
;; rate to survive in that environment.  I think you are right,
;; if you actually think that the current business model of
;; development will continue into the future.  But I suspect
;; that it will be gone shortly.  I suspect that in not very
;; many years most "intellectual" jobs will be better done by
;; AI systems and there will be no jobs needed (including
;; professors) in that future world.  So the only value of
;; creative work like programming will be for the pleasure of
;; the work and sharing that work with friends (as art and
;; music and literature are for the people who do it).  My kind
;; of programming is partly aimed at that future.

;; Your third and fourth paragraphs are really where we
;; disagree.  I am quite aware of that other world, outside of
;; my constructed palace.  I am trying to show you how to build
;; a palace of your own, independent of the base system and
;; language.  I know that is not the prevailing wisdom of the
;; computer-science "professionals".  But I do not believe in
;; the long-term viability of their approach, partly for the
;; reason described above, but also because I see the very bad
;; quality of the software that results from that approach.
;; How much novelty do we want?  There are tradeoffs between
;; novelty and longevity, quality, and reliability of systems
;; based on software.

;; But I want to emphasize that the SDF book is NOT about how
;; how to adopt MY codebase and how to use it.  It is to
;; illustrate the advantages of making such a "palace" and
;; showing you that it is not very hard to make one for
;; youself, on whatever platform you have, as needed.

;; Anyway, I never worry about "a personal attack on my
;; philosophy".  There are two reasons: Philosophy is meant to
;; be attacked, because it is never "correct".  What is more
;; important is that it is always OK to attack ideas, so long
;; as we do not attack the people who have those ideas.  I
;; learned very early that it is both fun and illuminating to
;; argue about ideas.  So have fun :-)

;; BTW: I started programming in 1962, on an IBM 650 in machine
;; language, so I have been programming for over 60 years
;; (mostly recreationally)!  My friend Chris Hanson has been
;; programming professionally for over 40 years (27 years for
;; me at MIT and 16 years in industry, 10 of those years at
;; Google), so together we have over 100 years of programming
;; experience.
